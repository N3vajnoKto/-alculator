Enter an expression and press ENTER to get the answer.
If the calculator cannot calculate the expression, it will notify you.
sign '=' does not need to be written in the expression.
Real calculator can perform the following operations:
a + b                    sum of numbers
a - b                    difference of numbers
a * b                    multiplication of numbers
ab                       multiplication of numbers
a / b                    division of numbers
a ** b                   a to degree b
sqrt(a, b)               root extraction of the degree b

a!                       factorial a
a & b                     bitwise and
a | b                     bitwise or
a ^ b                     bitwise xor
~a                        bitwise not
a << b                    bitwise left shift
a >> b                    bitwise right shift
