Enter an expression and press ENTER to get the answer.
If the calculator cannot calculate the expression, it will notify you.
sign '=' does not need to be written in the expression.
Calculator can perform the following operations:
a + b                    sum of numbers
a - b                    difference of numbers
a * b                    multiplication of numbers
ab                       multiplication of numbers
a / b                    division of numbers
a % b                    remainder of the division of integer parts of numbers
a ** b                   a to degree b
sqrt(a, b)               root extraction of the degree b
a!                       factorial integer part of a
sin(a)
cos(a)
tg(a)
ctg(a)
sec(a)
csc(a)
arcsin(a)
arccos(a)
arctg(a)
arcctg(a)
log(a, b)                 base a logarithm
ln(a)                     natural logarithm
a & b                     bitwise and
a | b                     bitwise or
a ^ b                     bitwise xor
~a                        bitwise not
a << b                    bitwise left shift
a >> b                    bitwise right shift
